# IPL-Score-Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) innings based on current match conditions. It uses historical match data to train regression models that consider key factors like overs completed, runs scored, and wickets lost.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
Data preprocessing using Pandas

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Model building using regression algorithms from Scikit-learn

Evaluation using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error

Deployed in a Jupyter Notebook for easy demonstration

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
